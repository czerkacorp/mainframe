# Mainframe

Mainframe is a lightweight REST API built with NodeJS that is designed to make interaction with SWGEMu Core3 based MySQL servers easier than ever. Want to integrate your existing application's accounts with SWGEmu? Interested in building a quick sign up with no complex logic? Simple! Just deploy Mainframe and call the API endpoints using any HTTP API.

If you are interested in a standalone account management system or are unsure of how to use Mainframe, check out [Citadel](https://github.com/czerkacorp/citadel), one of our other flagship applications.
